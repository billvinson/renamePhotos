renamePhotos
============

Simple PowerShell script to rename my photos to the appropriate naming scheme

Working to get things into a useful state.

Currently built around the the following assumptions:
 - taglib 2.1.0 (aquired via nuget) - http://www.nuget.org/packages/taglib/
 - written to run off user's linked OneDrive setup
